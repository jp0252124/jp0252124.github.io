        <p>I am a first year Astrophysics Ph.D. with experience researching for NASA, Cornell, and UC Berkley. 
        I completed my undergraduate studies at Cornell University, where I became skilled in Python and other tasks related to space and astronomy. 
        I've investigated pulsars and coronal holes as a researcher, identifying the moments where pulses and jets were generated in these occurences using Python code.
        Prior to my education, I was raised in Houston and was immediately fascinated by the likelihood of extraterrestrial life existing and how incredible the sky looked at night.</p>
